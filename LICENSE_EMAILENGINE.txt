IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MAY NOT USE THE COMMERCIAL

ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE AUTHORITY TO AGREE TO THIS
AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF SUCH ENTITY. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, DO NOT

product or service. Postalsys is not obligated to provide maintenance and support
services for the EmailEngine Software licensed under this Agreement.

2.3   Third Party Software. The Commercial Features may contain or be provided
with third party open source libraries, components, utilities and other open
source software (collectively, "Open Source Software"). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, use of the Open Source Software will be subject to the

3.2   Effect of Termination. Upon any termination of this Agreement, for any
reason, You will promptly cease use of the Commercial Features and destroy any

EMAILENGINE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED.

4.2   Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT WILL POSTALSYS OR ITS LICENSORS BE
LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR (I) ANY AMOUNTS IN
EXCESS OF US $50 OR (II) FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF
ANY KIND, INCLUDING FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION,

5. MISCELLANEOUS

5.1   Assignment. You may not assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement or any
rights or obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, whether by operation of
law or otherwise, to any third party without Postalsys' prior written consent.
Any purported transfer, assignment or delegation without such prior written
consent will be null and void and of no force or effect. Postalsys may assign
this Agreement to any successor to its business or assets to which this
Agreement relates, whether by merger, sale of assets, sale of stock,
reorganization or otherwise. Subject to this Section 5.1, this Agreement will be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

5.2   Entire Agreement; Modification; Waiver. This Agreement represents the
entire agreement between the parties, and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, written or oral, with respect to the matters covered by this
Agreement, and is not intended to confer upon any third party any rights or
remedies hereunder. You acknowledge that You have not entered in this Agreement
based on any representations other than those contained herein. No modification
of or amendment to this Agreement, nor any waiver of any rights under this
Agreement, will be effective unless in writing and signed by both parties. The
waiver of one breach or default or any delay in exercising any rights will not
constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default.

5.3   Governing Law. This Agreement will in all respects be governed by the laws
of Estonia without reference to its principles of conflicts of
laws. The parties hereby agree that all disputes arising out of this Agreement
will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the county courts

jurisdiction and venue of these courts. The parties hereby disclaim and exclude
the application hereto of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
the International Sale of Goods.

5.4   Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable under applicable law by a court of competent jurisdiction, it will
be replaced with the valid provision that most closely reflects the intent of
the parties and the remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full
force and effect.

5.5   Relationship of the Parties. Nothing in this Agreement is to be construed
as creating an agency, partnership, or joint venture relationship between the
parties hereto. Neither party will have any right or authority to assume or
create any obligations or to make any representations or warranties on behalf of
any other party, whether express or implied, or to bind the other party in any
respect whatsoever.
