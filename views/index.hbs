            EmailEngine is an email client software designed for applications, not
            individual users. It connects to users' email servers and translates REST API requests from the app into
            IMAP and SMTP commands, or into Gmail API or Microsoft Graph API requests. Additionally, it sends webhooks
            to notify the app of events such as new or deleted emails.
